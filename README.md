[SIGNS dataset](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W1/Convolution_model_Application_v1a.ipynb)  
To implemented the ConvNet using tensorflow, to classify images in SIGNS dataset  
   

* #### **Week 2**  
[Residual Networks](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W2/Residual_Networks_v2a.ipynb)  
Build the basic building blocks of residual networks, then train the ResNet using SIGNS dataset  
   
   
* #### **Week 3**  
[Car Detection](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W3/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection_v3a.ipynb)  
Implement the score thresholding and non max suppression algorithm to filter out the excess bounding boxes, use pre-trained weights of the YOLO model to detect the cars.  
   
   
* #### **Week 4**  
[Neural Style Transfer Algorithm](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W4/Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer_v3a.ipynb)  
Implement the NST algorithm to generate the artistic images. It uses a previously trained network and builds on top of that.  
  
[Face Verification and Recognition](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W4/Face/Face_Recognition_v3a.ipynb)  
Implement the triplet loss function, which is used to train neural network to learn encoding of an image. We can use same encoding to solve face recognition problem  
  
  
## Sequence Models
* #### **Week 1**  
[Building the Recurrent Neural Network](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Sequence_models/W1/Building_a_Recurrent_Neural_Network_Step_by_Step_v3b.ipynb)  
Build the components of RNN and LSTM in numpy  

[Character Level Language Model](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Sequence_models/W1/Dinosaurus_Island_Character_level_language_model_final_v3b.ipynb)  
To implement the character level text generation RNN and then trained it to generate the plausible name of the dinosaurs  

[Improvise a Jazz Solo with an LSTM Network](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Sequence_models/W1/Improvise_a_Jazz_Solo_with_an_LSTM_Network_v3a.ipynb)  
To implement the model that uses LSTM to generate music  
  
  
* #### **Week 2**  
[Operations on Word Vectors](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Sequence_models/W2/Operations_on_word_vectors_v2a.ipynb)  
Implement the cosine similarity function to compare similarity between pair of words (useful in analogy problems).  
  
  
[Emojify](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/Sequence_models/W2/Emojify_v2a.ipynb)  
Implement a model which inputs a sentence and finds the most appropriate emoji to be used. The first model uses word embeddings and the second one uses LSTM.
