# Deep Learning Courses

## Convolutional Neural Network
* #### **Week 1**  
[Conv Net Model - Step by Step](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W1/Convolution_model_Step_by_Step_v2a.ipynb)  
Implemented the CONV and POOLING layers in numpy, both forward and backward propagation

[SIGNS dataset](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W1/Convolution_model_Application_v1a.ipynb)  
Implemented the ConvNet using tensorflow, to classify images in SIGNS dataset  
  
* #### **Week 2**  
[Residual Networks](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W2/Residual_Networks_v2a.ipynb)
Implemented the basic building blocks of residual networks, then train the ResNet using SIGNS dataset  
  
* #### **Week 3**  
[Car Detection](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W3/Autonomous_driving_application_Car_detection_v3a.ipynb)  
Implemented the score thresholding and non max suppression algorithm to filter out the excess bounding boxes. Used pre-trained weights of the YOLO model to detect the cars.  
  
* #### **Week 4**  
[Neural Style Transfer Algorithm](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W4/Art_Generation_with_Neural_Style_Transfer_v3a.ipynb)  
Implement the NST algorithm to generate the artistic images. It uses a previously trained network and builds on top of that.  
  
[Face Verification and Recognition](https://github.com/virtually-real1/Deep-Learning-Specialization/blob/main/convolutional_NN/W4/Face/Face_Recognition_v3a.ipynb)  
Implemented the triplet loss function, which is used to train neural network to learn encoding of an image. We can use same encoding to solve face recognition problem
